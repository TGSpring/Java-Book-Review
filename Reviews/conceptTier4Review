THIS IS A REVIEW I ASKED CHAT TO DO AFTER IT READ THE WHOLE CODE BASE
THIS IS FOR ME AND MY REINFORCEMENT
TAKE IT AS YOU WILL I DONT CARE

Tier 4 Algorithms

Q1: Longest Increasing Subsequence
    Given an array: [3, 10, 2, 1, 20]
    What's the length of the longest increasing subsequence? How would you reason it out step by step?

        - 2. 3 and 10. You would just have a for loop go over it and a conditional inside that checks if index i + 1 
        is bigger than the value of index i. If not, it is not increasing, if true, increment a length var.

Q2: Array Pair Sum
    Given an array [1, 4, 5, 2]  and a target sum 6, which pairs of indices produce this sum?
    Think systematically.

        - indices (0, 2) and (1, 3) work. You could do a nested for loop and have i iterate over the array with j and save the pairs
        as the summat to 6. Or you could rework a sorting method like bubble or even selection, but probably overkill here.

Q3: Detect Duplicate
    You have [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]. How can you detect a duplicate without sorting the array? Walk through your logic.

        - It seems I answered this somewhat with Q2. Nested loops, if i matches any j + 1 indices then save them to a var. Now I
        am guessing Q2 should be a sorting type answer.

Q4: Reverse Words in String 
    Given "hello world here", how would you reverse the words(not letters) programmatically? What's the output?

        - Firstly output is just "here world hello". To reverse, assuming it is one string, you could make a loop to read over it 
        backwards, use a delimited for the spaces and append them to a new string? Then add spaces? Unless you want to read 
        every char then make a new string that way.

Q5: Max SubArray Sum (Kadane's Algorithm)
    Given [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], what is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray? How do you figure it out 
    step by step?

        - Keep track of currentSum, the sum of the subarray at the current index, maxSum is the largest.
        At each element, decide whether to add it to the current subarray or start a new subarray. Update maxSum if currentSum 
        is bigger than maxSum.
