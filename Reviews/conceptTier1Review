THIS IS A REVIEW I ASKED CHAT TO DO AFTER IT READ THE WHOLE CODE BASE
THIS IS FOR ME AND MY REINFORCEMENT
TAKE IT AS YOU WILL I DONT CARE

- Java is a strongly typed langauge so every variable must have a declared type.

    int count = 5;
    double rate = 2.75;
    String name = "Tyler";
    boolean done = false;

- Expressions combine values and operators to produce new values.

    int x = 5 + 2 * 3; // 11

    Remember order of operations applies.

- Conditionals are used for decision making:

    if (x > 10) {
        System.out.println("big number"); 
    } else {
        System.out.println("smaller number");
    }

- Loops are used for repetition.

    for = count based, while = condition based.

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        System.out.println(i)
    }

- Methods are reuseable blocks of code. They can take inputs/parameters and return outputs.

    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    calling:
        int sum = add(3, 4);

QUIZ:

Q1. What will this print?
    int a = 3; 
    int b = 7;
    System.out.println(a + b * 2)

    ANSWER = 17.

Q2. What's the difference between == and = in Java?

    ANSWER: == is boolean expression = is an assignment.

Q3. What will be the output?

    int n = 10;
    if (n < 5) {
        System.out.println("A");
    } else if (n < 10) {
        System.out.println("B");
    } else {
        System.out.println("C");
    }

    ANSWER: C

Q4. What does this loop print?

    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
    }

    ANSWER: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Q5. What does this method return when called with mystery(3)?

        public static int mystery(int x) {
        int y = x * 2;
        y = y + 1;
        return y;
    }

    ANSWER: 7
