Smart Personal Finance Assistant plan

1. Loan calculator with error handling
	- Modify the loan calculator to handle inputs (negatives, zeros, or non-numeric input).
	- Allow user to enter multiple loan scenarios and store them in an array for later review.
	CHALLENGE:
		Implement a method that takes an array of different loans and returns the lowest monthly payment.

2. Expense Tracker with Categorization & Sorting
	- Allow users to categorize expenses under Rent, Food, Entertainment, Miscellaneous, etc.
 	- Store expenses in an ArrayList (instead of an array for dynamic resizing).

	- Provide options to:
 		Sort expenses from highest to lowest.
		Get the top 3 most expensive transactions.
Challenge: Implement a method that takes an expense category as a parameter and returns the total spent in that category.

3. Savings Goal Estimator with Adjustable Contributions
	- Instead of fixed savings, let the user adjust their monthly contributions dynamically and recalculate in real-time.
	- Offer a projection for 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years based on compound interest.
Challenge: Allow the user to input a monthly increase in their savings contribution and factor it into the projections.

4. Budget Category Name Analyzer
	- In addition to reversing budget category names,
	- Convert them to uppercase for formatting.
 	- Count vowels and consonants in each category name.

5. Transaction Date Formatting & Validation
 	- Ensure the day is within valid limits (1-31), month is valid, and year is not in the past.
 	- If invalid, prompt the user until they enter a valid date.
Challenge: Convert the formatted date into a Unix timestamp for potential database use.

6. Encrypted Password Storage in a File
 	- Encrypt the userâ€™s password using Caesar cipher.
 	- Store the encrypted password in a text file.
 	- Allow the user to retrieve and decrypt their password when needed.
Challenge: Ask the user if they want to add a unique salt value to their password before encrypting for additional security.

7. BONUS: Report Generation
 	- At the end of the session, generate a financial summary report that includes:
 	- Loan details (highest and lowest monthly payment).
 	- Expense breakdown by category.
 	- Savings projections.
 	- Transaction history with formatted dates.
Write this report to a .txt file so users can save their results.
