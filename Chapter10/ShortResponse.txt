Chapter 10 Short Response Questions
----- I will be lessening the amount of these as well as the amount of programming problems I do in order to add in a project per chapter now. --------

Section 10.1: ArrayLists

Question 1: What is an ArrayList? In what cases should you use an ArrayList rather than an array?
    - An ArrayList is a Java class that stores elements in a resizable array and provides easy methods to add, remove, or access items. Use an ArrayList when you 
    need a collection that can grow or shrink dynamically, such as a list of calendar events. Use an array when the number of elements is fixed and you want the most
    efficient use of memory and speed, like storing the days of the week.


Section 10.2: The Comparable Interface 

Question 19: Describe how to arrange an ArrayList into sorted order. What must be true about the type of elements in the list in order to sort it?
    - To sort an ArrayList, you can use Collections.sort(list) or list.sort(). For sorting to work, the elements must either implement the Comparable interface, 
    using compareTo method that defines natural ordering or you must provide a Comparator, a separate comparison function to the sort method. Built-in types like String 
    and Integer already implement Comparable, so they can be sorted directly. For custom types, like a Point class, you must either make your class implement Comparable
    and define compareTo(), or provide a Comparator when sorting.
