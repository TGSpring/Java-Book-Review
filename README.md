# Java Book Review

**Author:** Tyler Spring  
**Purpose:** A comprehensive, hands-on review of *Building Java Programs* through exercises, projects, and notes. Designed as a personal reference, practice repository, and eventually a searchable AI-powered learning resource.

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through *Building Java Programs*, covering Chapters 1–15. It includes:

- **Implemented exercises & projects:** Code written directly from the textbook problems, adhering strictly to problem constraints.  
- **Test files:** Each project includes a corresponding test file to validate functionality.  
- **Chapter notes & summaries:** Reflections, key concepts, and insights to reinforce understanding.  
- **Future AI integration:** Eventually, the repo will serve as a searchable reference with AI assistance for queries on Java concepts and project solutions.

## Highlights & Learning Goals

- Strict adherence to textbook constraints for each problem.  
- Emphasis on **understanding over copying**, with detailed notes for each project.  
- Incremental code complexity: simple exercises → object-oriented programming → collections → custom data structures.  
- Experimentation with **test-driven learning** (writing test files alongside implementations).  
- Preparing for **portfolio-quality projects** and interview-ready code examples.

## Current Progress

- **Chapters 1–15 implemented**  
- **Projects tested and validated**  
- **Notes and reflections maintained** for each chapter  
- **Chapter 15 ArrayIntList** added and verified with test output `[10, 20, 30]`

## Future Plans

1. **AI-powered documentation & search portal** – Implement a system to query exercises, code examples, and notes.  
2. **Portfolio-quality polishing** – Refactor, add Doxygen-style comments, and prepare visual diagrams for complex classes and projects.  
3. **LinkedIn showcase updates** – Share learning milestones, project outcomes, and coding insights publicly.
