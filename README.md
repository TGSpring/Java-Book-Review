# Java Review: Building Java Programs

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to systematically reviewing and reinforcing concepts from the book *Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach* by Stuart Reges. The goal of this effort is to:

1. **Refresh Java Knowledge**: Revisit foundational concepts to strengthen understanding of Java programming and ensure readiness for advanced topics.
2. **Hands-On Practice**: Work through short-answer questions and programming exercises to solidify learning through practical application.
3. **Build a Learning Habit**: Develop a consistent routine of studying and applying programming knowledge daily.

## Approach
- **Section-by-Section Review**: Each session focuses on a specific section of the book, summarizing key ideas and clarifying complex topics.
- **Interactive Exercises**: Short-answer questions and programming problems from the end of each chapter are solved and analyzed to reinforce comprehension.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Concepts like `.class` files, `main()` method structure, and error handling are explored with depth and examples.

## Why This Matters
Revisiting the fundamentals ensures a strong foundation for building more advanced skills in Java programming and software development. This structured review helps to:
- Retain core concepts that are critical for technical interviews and real-world applications.
- Improve problem-solving abilities by breaking down questions and finding optimized solutions.
- Maintain consistency in learning and professional growth.

## Progress Tracking
Each completed chapter or exercise will be documented in the repository, with solutions and explanations provided for future reference. Current progress:
- **Chapter 1**: Complete (Short-answer questions underway)

## Next Steps
The plan is to continue with:
- Solving end-of-chapter questions for Chapter 1.
- Progressing to Chapter 2 after mastering Chapter 1 concepts and problems.
