Chapter 1 review questions:
1. What is the purpose of the main method in Java program?
  The purpose of the manin method in a java program is to serve as the entry point for execution. The 
JVM starts running the program from the main method. It initializes the program by creating objects,
setting up variables, and calling other methods as needed. Its signature is:
"public static main void(String[] args)"
public: makes the mehtod accessible to the JVM
static: Aloows the mehtod to be called without creating an instance of the class.
void: Indicates the mehtod doesn not return any value.
String[] args: Endables passing command-line arguments to the program.


2. What is the role of the .class file?
  A .class file contains the bytecode of a Java program, which is a platform-independent, itermediate representation of the code.
This file is generated by the Java compiler javac after compiling the .java source file.
  The role of the .class file:
    It allows the JVM to interpret and execute the program.
    It acts as teh runnable version of your program, indpendent of the underlying system, ensuring Java's write once, run anywhere logic.
  The .class file is not specific to a particular operating system or hardware but rather works across all platforms with a compatilbe JVM.

3. What is the difference between a compile-time and a runtime error?
  Compile time error:
    Occurs during the compilation phase, before the program is ran.
    These errors are usually related to violations of the langauge's snytax or rules.
    EXAMPLE: int number = "hello"; //Type mismatch.

  Runtime Error:
    Occurs while the program is executing, after it has successfully compiled.
    These errors are often caused by incorrect logic, invalid input, or unexpected conditions
    EXAMPLE: int result = 10 / 0; //Division by zero causes a runtime error.

In short compile-time errors prevent the program from running, while runtime errors crash during execution.
