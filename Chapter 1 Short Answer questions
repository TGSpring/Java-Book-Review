1. What is the purpose of the main method in Java program?
  The purpose of the manin method in a java program is to serve as the entry point for execution. The 
JVM starts running the program from the main method. It initializes the program by creating objects,
setting up variables, and calling other methods as needed. Its signature is:
"public static main void(String[] args)"
public: makes the mehtod accessible to the JVM
static: Aloows the mehtod to be called without creating an instance of the class.
void: Indicates the mehtod doesn not return any value.
String[] args: Endables passing command-line arguments to the program.
