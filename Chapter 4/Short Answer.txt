Chapter 4 short answer questions


1. What is the purpose of an if/else statement in Java?
	Create decision based programs based on conditionals.

2. How does the else if statement help avoid unnecessary checks in conditional logic?
	It helps avoid unnecessary checks by ensuring that once a condition is met, the rest are skipped. This makes the program more efficient 
than using multiple independent if statements. 

3. What is a cumulative algorithm, and how does it work?
	A cumulative algorithm calculates an expression during each iteration to keep track of a running
total, such as a sum or product.

4. How would you modify a loop that calculates a cumulative sum to instead calculate a cumulative product?
	Instead of +=, just use *=.  Ensure the initial value is set
to 1, not 0, to prevent multiplication by zero.

5. How can you check if a given string contains only numeric characters in Java?
	Using a regular expression (regex) with .matches. For numbers it is str.matches("[0-9]+");

6. What does the .substring() method do, and how would you use it to extract the first three characters of a string?
	Substring extracts characters from a given string within a specified range. To extract the first three characters, use
.substring(0,3), since substring excludes the last index.

7. What is conditional execution inside a method, and why is it useful?
	Used with if else or nested if statements. Good for using different blocks of code based on previous
conditionals.

8. public static String checkAge(int age) {
	if(age >= 18) {
		return "Adult";
	} else {
		return "Minor";
	}
	
}

9. What formula is used to calculate BMI, and what are the general BMI categories?
	The BMI formula is weight / (height * height), but ^2 should not be used as it represents bitwise XOR in Java.
	underweight, normalweight, overweight, obese.

10. Why is using a method to calculate BMI better than writing the logic directly in main()?
	modular design, cleaner easier to maintain code, effective use of OOP, divide and conquer.
