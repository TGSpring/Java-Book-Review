/**
 * Analysis
 * Input Size Consideration:
 * 
 * How many inputs does your function receive?
 * - 2
 * Does the number of operations depend on any variable length property of the
 * input (e.g., the number of digits or characters)?
 * - No
 * 
 * Operations Performed:
 * 
 * What are the specific mathematical operations your method performs?
 * - Division and multiplication
 * Are these operations constant (e.g., multiplication, addition), or do they
 * vary with the input?
 * - constant
 * 
 * Loop or Recursion Check:
 * 
 * Does your method use any loops or recursive calls?
 * - No
 * If not, how many operations are executed regardless of the input values?
 * - 2
 * Space Allocation:
 * 
 * Apart from the input values, do you allocate any additional data structures
 * (arrays, lists, etc.)?
 * - No
 * How much extra memory do you allocateâ€”is it fixed regardless of input?
 * - 1 variable num in the bmi method
 * 
 * Constant Factors vs. Variable Factors:
 * 
 * After answering the above, can you determine if the execution time grows with
 * the input size (n) or stays constant, no matter what values are supplied?
 * - Time and Space complexity are O(1).
