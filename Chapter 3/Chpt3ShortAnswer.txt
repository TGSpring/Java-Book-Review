Chapter 3 short answer questions.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and a constant in a method? Why might you use one over the other?
   - Parameters are variables passed to a function or method, used only within the scope of that function or method. Once the function or method completes, the parameter is destroyed. If there is a return type, only a copy of the variable is returned. The same applies to what is passed to the parameter of that function; it is only a copy of the variable.
   - Constants are immutable values that cannot be altered once they are set. They are usually declared with the `final` keyword and can have a global scope or be created within a specific scope. Constants are useful for refactoring, debugging, and validation because their values remain consistent throughout the program.

2. Explain how method overloading works. Provide an example where overloading might be useful.
   - Method overloading is when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but 
   different parameters (different type, number, or both). 
   This allows methods to perform similar but slightly different tasks based on the input parameters.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class MathUtils {
         // Overloaded method for adding two integers
         public int add(int a, int b) {
             return a + b;
         }

         // Overloaded method for adding three integers
         public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
             return a + b + c;
         }

         // Overloaded method for adding two doubles
         public double add(double a, double b) {
             return a + b;
         }
     }
     ```
   - Overloading is useful when you want to provide multiple ways to perform a similar 
   operation, such as adding different numbers of values or handling different data types.
