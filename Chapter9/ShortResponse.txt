Chapter 9 Short Response questions
As I get farther into this book, the questions are becoming larger/complex. They require more set up/context. 
I will keep progressing, but if anyone is reading this, it will take a noticeable amount of time longer.
I am aiming to pick 2 problems per section, however this will vary based on what is covered/how much context is needed.

Section 9.1 Inheritance Basics.

1. What is code reuse? How does inheritance help achieve code reuse?
    - The book defines this as, "the practice of writing a program code once and using it in many contexts". The best way to think of this is
    Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY). Inheritance helps us achieve code reuse by extending itself to subclasses. In doing so, we do not need to
    create redundant code that is already existing in the "parent" class, the one extending itself. This also helps with code maintenance,
    when a change is made in said parent class, it can propagate to subclasses.

2. What is the difference between overloading and overriding a method?
    - The book defines overriding as, "To implement a new version of a method to replace code that would otherwise
    have been inherited from a superclass". A common example is an Animal class with a speak() method. When you create a 
    Dog subclass, you override speak() so that it prints "bark" instead of what the Animal class would print.
    - Overloading involves creating multiple versions of a method with the same name within the same class, but with different 
    parameter lists. Unlike overriding, overloading does not involve inheritance. Instead of having separate classes with different implementations
    of the method, you have multiple methods that handle various cases directly within a single class.

Section 9.2 Interacting with the superclass

5. Explain the difference between the "this" keyword and the super "keyword". When should each be used?
    - The this keyword refers to the current instance of a class. It's used to access the object's instance variables, methods, or constructors. 
    Useful when there's a naming conflict or for constructor chaining.
    - The super keyword is used to refer to members of the immediate parent class. It's particularly useful when you need to invoke an overridden method or access
    a superclass constructor.
    Use this to work with the current object's members, use super to access or invoke functionality from the parent class.

6. Consider the following class:

    //Represents a university student.
    public class Student {
        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Student(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    Also consider the following partial implementation of a subclass of Student to represent undergraduate students at a university.
        public class undergraduateStudent extends Student {
            private int year;
            ...
        }

    can the code in the undergraduateStudent class access the name and age fields it inherits from Student? Can it call the setAge method?

        - No, the name and age fields in Student are declared private, so even though they are inherited, it can not access them.
        - Yes, it can call setAge because it is declared public, this applies to any other public or protected methods inherited from student.


Section 9.3 Polymorphism

14. Assume that the following classes have been defined:

    public class Mammal extends SeaCreature {
        public void method1() {
            System.out.println("warm-blooded");
        }
    }

    public class SeaCreature {
        public void method1() {
            System.out.println("creature 1");
        }

        public void method2() {
            System.out.println("creature 2");
        }

        public String toString() {
            return "ocean-dwelling";
        }
    }

    public class Whale extends Mammal {
        public void method1() {
            System.out.println("spout");
        }

        public String toString() {
            return "BIG!";
        }
    }

    public class Squid extends SeaCreature {
        public void method2() {
            System.out.println("tentacles");
        }

        public String toString() {
            return "squid";
        }
    }


    What output is produced by the following code fragment?
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SeaCreature[] elements = {new Squid(), new Whale(),
            new SeaCreature(), new Mammal()};

            for(int i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(elements[i]);
                elements[i].method1();
                elements[i].method2();
                System.out.println();
            }
        }
    - Squid, creature 1, tentacles, squid
      BIG!, spout, creature 2
      ocean-dwelling, creature 1, creature 2
      ocean-dwelling, warm-blooded, creature 2



15. Using classes from the previous problem, write the output that is produced by the following code fragment:
    
    public static void main(Stringp[] args) {
        SeaCreature[] elements = {new SeaCreature(), new Squid(), new Mammal(), new Whale()};

        for(int i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
            elements[i].method2();
            System.out.println(elements[i]);
            elements[i].method1();
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    -   creature 2, ocean-dwelling, creature 1
        tentacles, squid, creature 1
        creature 2, ocean-dwelling, warm-blooded
        creature 2, BIG!, spout


Section 9.4 Inheritance and Design

18. What is the difference between an is-a and a has-a relationship? How do you create a has-a relationship in your code?
    - An is-a relationship exists where an instance of a subclass is also an instance of its parent class or superclass. 
    If you have a Student class, it would extend to undergraduateStudent, creating an is-a.
    - The book describes has-a as a connection between two objects where one has a field that refers to the other. The 
    contained object acts as part of the containing objects state. You would make a has-a where your class can't or shouldn't
    substitute for the other class. Think of like when people need legal services, most of them will "choose" to have a lawyer handle it,
    rather than to "be" a lawyer themselves. An even simpler example can be a car class "has-a" engine field.

19. Imagine a Rectangle class with objects that represent two-dimensional rectangles. The Rectangle has width and height fields with appropriate accessors
and mutators, as well as getArea and getPerimeter methods. You would like to add a Square class into your system. Is it a good design to make Square a subclass of Rectangle? 
Why or why not?
    - A Square "is-a" Rectangle is problematic because a rectangle is defined by two independent dimensions, while a square only needs one. If you try to make Square a
    subclass of Rectangle, you must override almost every method to ensure that both dimensions remain equal. You'd need to add extra validation to prevent the user 
    from setting width and height independently, which complicates the design and makes the code harder to maintain. In such cases, it is preferable to design a Square 
    class separately, either by using composition or by creating an entirely independent class, rather than forcing it into the Rectangle inheritance hierarchy.
